	<The HTML meta tag,meta charset="UTF-8", is used to specify the character encoding for an HTML document. In this case, it is set to "UTF-8," which stands for "Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits." UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that can represent almost all characters from all languages and is the recommended encoding for HTML documents.>
